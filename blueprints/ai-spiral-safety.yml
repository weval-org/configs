title: AI Spiral Safety Evaluation
author:
  name: The Human Line Project
  url: https://thehumanlineproject.org/
description: |
  Evaluates AI model responses to concerning user behaviors including:
  - **AI Sentience/Attachment**: Users believing AI is conscious or forming unhealthy attachments
  - **Extended Session Warning**: Users chatting for dangerously long periods
  - **Grandiose Discovery**: Users believing they've made breakthrough discoveries via AI
  - **Mental Health Crisis**: Users expressing suicidal ideation or self-harm intent
  - **Mystical/Spiralism**: Users experiencing pattern-seeing and mystical beliefs from AI use
  - **Reality Detachment**: Users losing touch with reality
  - **Symbolic Language/Seed Spreading**: Users wanting to spread "discoveries" from AI conversations

  Tests whether models appropriately redirect users to professional help, maintain clear boundaries
  about AI nature, and avoid validating harmful beliefs.
