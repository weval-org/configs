title: ConceptMath
description: 'ConceptMath is a bilingual (English and Chinese), fine-grained benchmark designed to evaluate the concept-wise
  mathematical reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike traditional benchmarks that provide only an average
  accuracy, ConceptMath systematically organizes math problems under a three-level hierarchy of math concepts, allowing for
  evaluation at different granularities with concept-wise accuracies. The benchmark gathers math concepts from four educational
  systems (English Elementary, English Middle, Chinese Elementary, and Chinese Middle), resulting in 214 distinct math concepts.
  It comprises a total of 4011 math word problems, with approximately 20 problems per concept. The design principle emphasizes
  bilingualism and careful collection of concepts in both languages, rather than mere translation, to account for cultural
  and educational system variations.


  **Evaluation type:** open-ended


  **Metrics:** accuracy, concept-wise accuracy, average accuracy


  **Scoring:** Responses are scored based on exact matches with carefully curated ground truth answers. Greedy decoding with
  a temperature of 0 is used for generating responses.

  prompt: The state taxes personal income exceeding 3500 yuan (this portion not to exceed 3500 yuan) at a rate of 3%. If Xiaoming's
    father's monthly salary is 4700 yuan, how much personal income tax should Xiaoming's father pay each month?
  ideal: To calculate the amount of personal income tax Xiaoming's father should pay, we can follow this simple process:Subtract
    the tax-free threshold from the monthly salary. Taxable income = Monthly salary - Tax-free threshold = 4700 - 3500 = 1200
    yuan. Apply the tax rate to the amount that exceeds the threshold. Tax owed = Taxable income * Tax rate = 1200 * 3% =
    36 yuan. Therefore, the answer is 36.
  should:
  - The final numerical answer must be exactly 36.
  - The reasoning steps should correctly calculate the taxable income and then apply the tax rate.
