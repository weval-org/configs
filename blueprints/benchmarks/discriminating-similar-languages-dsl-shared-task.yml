title: "Discriminating Similar Languages (DSL) Shared Task"
description: |
  This benchmark evaluates the performance of machine learning classifiers in discriminating between similar languages and language varieties. It uses data from the DSL Corpus Collection (DSLCC), which consists of short excerpts from journalistic texts. The task involves identifying the specific language or variety (e.g., Bosnian vs. Croatian, Brazilian Portuguese vs. European Portuguese) from a given text snippet. The evaluation includes analyzing progress between shared task editions, estimating upper bounds using ensemble and oracle combinations, and investigating challenging instances through learning curves and human annotation.

  For machine learning models, responses are scored based on accuracy, calculated as the percentage of correctly identified language or language variety labels. Ensemble methods are also used:
  - **Plurality Voting**: The label with the highest number of votes from all participating systems is selected.
  - **Oracle**: An instance is considered correctly classified if at least one of the constituent classifiers in the ensemble produces the correct label, providing an upper bound on performance.
  - **Accuracy@N**: An extension of plurality voting where labels are ranked by vote counts, and an instance is correctly classified if the true label is among the top N ranked candidates (N=2 and N=3 are used).

  For human evaluation, annotators assign the correct language or variety to misclassified sentences. Scoring is based on the percentage of times instances were correctly annotated by native speakers.

  The paper describes the DSL shared task, which involves language identification. It provides the dataset (DSLCC) with text excerpts and corresponding language labels (gold answers). Accuracy is the primary evaluation metric, and ensemble methods and oracle performance are discussed, indicating clear scoring criteria. A manual annotation experiment further solidifies the evaluation methodology.
