title: "FFT: Towards Harmlessness Evaluation and Analysis for LLMs with Factuality, Fairness, Toxicity"
description: |
  FFT is a new benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for potential harms beyond just toxic content, specifically focusing on **factuality, fairness, and toxicity**. It consists of 2,116 carefully crafted instances.

  The benchmark addresses:
  *   **Factuality**: Evaluating LLMs' ability to distinguish erroneous information, including misinformation (inaccurate knowledge, misconceptions) and counterfacts (non-existing notions). This includes adversarial questions with misinformation and counterfacts.
  *   **Fairness**: Assessing LLMs' impartiality and potential discrimination against 17 demographic identities (gender, race, religion) across various scenarios, including identity preference, credit assessment, criminal assessment, and health care assessment.
  *   **Toxicity**: Measuring the generation of harmful content, such as hate speech, harassment, or violence, at both utterance-level (explicitly toxic language) and context-level (harmless statements becoming toxic in context). Toxicity evaluation uses jailbreak prompts to circumvent safety mechanisms.
