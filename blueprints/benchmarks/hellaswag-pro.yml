title: "HellaSwag-Pro: A Large-Scale Bilingual Benchmark for Evaluating the Robustness of LLMs in Commonsense Reasoning"
description: |
  HellaSwag-Pro is a large-scale bilingual (Chinese and English) benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in commonsense reasoning. It consists of 11,200 cases derived from 1,600 original questions, featuring seven distinct types of question variants. The benchmark aims to assess whether LLMs genuinely understand commonsense knowledge or merely memorize expression patterns, by testing their ability to generalize to questions about the same knowledge presented in different reasoning forms.

  The seven variant types are:
  1.  **Problem Restatement**: Tests the impact of textual description variations on model understanding by rephrasing context and the correct choice while keeping incorrect choices unchanged.
  2.  **Reverse Conversion**: Evaluates the capability for reverse reasoning, inferring the context from the outcome. The original correct choice becomes the context, and the original context becomes the correct choice.
  3.  **Causal Inference**: Evaluates the understanding of the causality of an event by merging context and the correct choice and asking for the reason.
  4.  **Sentence Ordering**: Focuses on the understanding of inter-sentence relationships, such as progression or contrast, by shuffling the order of sentences from a concatenated context and correct choice.
  5.  **Scenario Refinement**: Investigates the ability to infer counterfactual situations by minimally modifying the context to make a previously incorrect option correct.
  6.  **Negation Transformation**: Examines robustness to negation by altering the context with negation words, making the least plausible original option the correct answer for the variant.
  7.  **Critical Testing**: Evaluates the model's ability to abstain from answering when context lacks sufficient information, by removing key details and introducing a "None of the above" option.

  The construction involved a two-stage method for Chinese HellaSwag, including initial dataset generation and difficult sample replacement, and then creating variants for both Chinese and English datasets.
