title: "HellaSwag: Can a Machine Really Finish Your Sentence?"
description: |
  HellaSwag is a challenging dataset designed to evaluate commonsense natural language inference in state-of-the-art models. It was created to overcome limitations of previous benchmarks like SWAG, where models achieved high performance by exploiting dataset-specific biases rather than true commonsense reasoning.

  The core methodology employs **Adversarial Filtering (AF)**, an iterative data collection paradigm where discriminators select machine-generated incorrect answers that are difficult for models but trivial for humans. The dataset focuses on physically situated commonsense reasoning, drawing contexts from ActivityNet video captions and WikiHow how-to articles.

  Each HellaSwag question presents a context followed by four ending choices, with only one being correct. While humans achieve over 95% accuracy, state-of-the-art models struggle significantly (below 48%), even with extensive training. This highlights that current models often rely on lexical reasoning rather than deep commonsense understanding.
