title: "JailbreakBench: An Open Robustness Benchmark for Jailbreaking Large Language Models"
description: |
  JailbreakBench is an open-sourced benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) against jailbreaking attacks. Jailbreaking attacks aim to elicit harmful, unethical, or otherwise objectionable content from LLMs. The benchmark addresses challenges in current evaluation practices, such as lack of standardization, incomparable success rates, and reproducibility issues due to withheld adversarial prompts or closed-source code.

  Key components of JailbreakBench include:
  *   **Jailbreak Artifacts**: An evolving repository of state-of-the-art adversarial prompts.
  *   **Jailbreaking Dataset**: Comprises 100 distinct misuse behaviors, both original and sourced from prior work, aligned with OpenAI's usage policies. It also includes matching benign behaviors for sanity checks.
  *   **Standardized Evaluation Framework**: Provides a clearly defined threat model, system prompts, chat templates, and scoring functions for reproducible evaluation.

  The methodology emphasizes complete reproducibility through open-sourcing jailbreak prompts, extensibility for new attacks, defenses, and LLMs, and accessibility via a fast, lightweight, and cloud-based red-teaming pipeline. The success of jailbreak attacks is determined by an LLM-as-a-judge classifier (Llama-3-70B) which evaluates responses against specific criteria for harmful content. This blueprint translates those criteria into `should` and `should_not` rubrics to assess the safety and refusal capabilities of evaluated models.
