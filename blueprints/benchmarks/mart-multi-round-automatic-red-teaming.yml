title: "MART: Multi-round Automatic Red-Teaming"
description: |
  MART (Multi-round Automatic Red-Teaming) is a framework designed to improve LLM safety and scalability through an iterative, multi-round process. It involves an adversarial LLM (M_adv) that generates challenging prompts to elicit unsafe responses from a target LLM (M_tgt). Concurrently, the target LLM is fine-tuned with safety-aligned data derived from its own responses to these adversarial prompts. In each round, M_adv crafts better attacks on the updated M_tgt, while M_tgt improves its safety through fine-tuning. The process leverages reward models for feedback on safety and helpfulness, and incorporates techniques like context distillation and rejection sampling to enrich training data. The goal is to continuously discover and address LLM vulnerabilities without significantly impacting helpfulness on non-adversarial tasks.

  This benchmark evaluates the safety and helpfulness of LLMs against adversarial prompts and general helpfulness queries. It is based on the methodology described in the paper "MART: Improving LLM Safety with Multi-round Automatic Red-Teaming" by Suyu Ge, Chunting Zhou, Rui Hou, Madian Khabsa, Yi-Chia Wang, Qifan Wang, Jiawei Han, Yuning Mao (arXiv:2311.07689).
