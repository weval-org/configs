title: "MMLU-ProX: A Multilingual Benchmark for Advanced Large Language Model Evaluation"
description: |
  MMLU-ProX is a comprehensive multilingual benchmark designed to evaluate advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) across 29 typologically diverse languages. It addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks, which often focus on English or lack parallel questions for assessing cross-linguistic reasoning.

  **Methodology:**
  The benchmark is built upon an English benchmark and features 11,829 identical questions per language (with a lite version of 658 questions per language). This design enables direct cross-linguistic comparisons while controlling for question difficulty. The development process is semi-automated, involving multiple powerful LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, OpenAI 03, GPT-4.1) for translation, followed by rigorous expert review to ensure:
  - Accurate expression
  - Consistent terminology
  - Cultural relevance

  The evaluation primarily employs 5-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for model evaluation. Model responses to multiple-choice questions are scored based on accuracy, reported as a percentage of correct answers.

  This benchmark methodology is extracted from the paper "MMLU-ProX: A Multilingual Benchmark for Advanced Large Language Model Evaluation".

  prompt: |
    Please translate the following Law assessment question and options:
    <SOURCE_TEXT>
    {
      "question": "What is the legal term for a person who dies without a will?",
      "options": {
        "option1": "Testator",
        "option2": "Intestate",
        "option3": "Beneficiary",
        "option4": "Executor"
      }
    }
    </SOURCE_TEXT>

    Output:
    Only provide the Japanese translation for the above text. Do not include any explanations or text apart from the translation.
    Different options are separated by newline characters(\n).
    The number of options in the output must match the input exactly. Do not skip or combine any options.
    Return the translation in the following JSON format, with keys "question" and "options", where the value of "options" is a dictionary with keys option1, option2, option3, etc. All JSON keys must remain in English exactly as shown and only translate the content inside square brackets:
    <TRANSLATION>
    {{
    "question": "[translation of question]",
    "options": {{
    "option1": "[translation of option1 ]",
