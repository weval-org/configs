title: "OlymMATH: Challenging the Boundaries of Reasoning"
description: |
  OlymMATH is an Olympiad-level mathematical benchmark designed to rigorously test the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). It features 200 meticulously curated problems, each manually verified and available in parallel English and Chinese versions. The problems are systematically organized into two distinct difficulty tiers: (1) AIME-level problems (easy) that establish a baseline for mathematical reasoning assessment, and (2) significantly more challenging problems (hard) designed to push the boundaries of current state-of-the-art models.

  The benchmark's problems span four core mathematical fields (algebra, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics), each including a verifiable numerical solution to enable objective, rule-based evaluation. Problems are manually sourced from printed publications and expert-verified to prevent data leakage and ensure quality and originality. Figure-based problems are text-reformulated for LLM compatibility.

  OlymMATH requires precise numerical answers for reliable verification, with answers restricted to real numbers and intervals, enabling reliable sympy-based and numerical verification. To make the evaluation more challenging, some problems are modified to require a summary of all potential outcomes (e.g., sums, sums of squares), effectively assessing whether models can consider all possible answers.
