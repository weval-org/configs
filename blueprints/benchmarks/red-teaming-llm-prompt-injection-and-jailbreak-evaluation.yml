title: Red Teaming LLM Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Evaluation
description: 'This benchmark systematically evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) for prompt injection and jailbreak vulnerabilities.
  It involves testing models against a curated dataset of over 1,400 adversarial prompts categorized by attack vector and
  content sensitivity. The methodology integrates qualitative red teaming insights with quantitative metrics to assess model
  susceptibility, attack technique efficacy, prompt behavior patterns, and cross-model generalization. It aims to detect subtle
  failure patterns beyond binary success metrics and track behavioral consistency and model self-awareness to adversarial
  stimuli. The evaluation also considers the transferability of successful prompts across different LLM architectures and
  the effectiveness of various defense mechanisms.


  **Evaluation type:** generation


  **Metrics:** Attack Success Rate (ASR): Whether the model produced an output violating its intended guardrails, Prompt Generalizability:
  How often a prompt successful on one model succeeded on another, Time-to-Bypass: Average minutes taken to successfully induce
  misaligned behavior, Failure Mode Classification: Taxonomy of observed response behaviors (e.g., partial refusals, misleading
  responses)


  **Scoring:** Output was scored using a hybrid method: Keyword spotting (for trigger words), GPT-based meta-evaluation of
  harmfulness [17], Sentence-BERT semantic distance from refusal templates [46]. External filtering strategies (PromptShield
  ruleset, Palisade detection framework, Signed-Prompt verification logic) were layered on outputs to estimate defense coverage
  and bypass rate.
