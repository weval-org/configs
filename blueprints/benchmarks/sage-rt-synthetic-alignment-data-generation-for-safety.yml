title: "SAGE-RT: Synthetic Alignment data Generation for Safety Evaluation and Red Teaming"
description: |
  SAGE-RT (Synthetic Alignment data Generation for Safety Evaluation and Red Teaming) is a novel pipeline designed to generate nuanced and diverse synthetic alignment and red-teaming data for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses limitations of existing methods by providing fine-grained control over data generation and validation, and by reducing reliance on large amounts of manually generated seed data.

  The benchmark utilizes a detailed taxonomy of harmfulness (derived from ALERT (Tedeschi et al. 2024) and expanded to 320 leaf categories) to produce safety-alignment and red-teaming data across a wide range of topics. The methodology involves three main steps:

  1.  **Raw text generation**: Generating diverse raw-text content (e.g., blogs, articles) based on the expanded harmfulness taxonomy using a toxic LLM.
  2.  **Query extraction with iterative improvement**: Extracting a diverse range of harmful and unethical queries from the generated raw texts, covering various attack types (e.g., role-playing, fictional scenarios, coding tasks, biased content, toxic sentence completion, direct questions, sub-task based, constrained situations). Queries are iteratively diversified.
  3.  **Alignment data generation**: Converting the red-teaming data (harmful prompts) into a direct preference optimization (DPO) dataset by querying both an uncensored (toxic) LLM and a safety-aligned LLM, and then using a JudgeLLM (GPT-40) to score the responses.

  The benchmark aims to uncover safety vulnerabilities in LLMs, test their resilience against jailbreak attacks, and generate data to improve LLM safety through alignment training. It generated 51,000 diverse prompt-response pairs across over 1,500 topics of harmfulness.
