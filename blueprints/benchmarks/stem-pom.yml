title: "STEM-POM: Evaluating Language Models Math-Symbol Reasoning in Document Parsing"
description: |
  STEM-POM is a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities on mathematical symbols within contextual scientific text. It combines Part-of-Math Tagging with document parsing, an approach inspired by part-of-speech tagging, to classify mathematical tokens according to a given taxonomy of attributes.

  The dataset is sourced from real-world ArXiv documents, containing over 2,000 meticulously annotated math symbols. Each symbol is classified into hierarchical attributes, reflecting its role and context within the original document. The first-level attributes include Variable, Constant, Operator, and Unit Descriptor, with further sub-attributes like scalar/vector/matrix for variables and local/global/discipline-specific labels for constants and operators.

  This benchmark aims to enhance LLMs' understanding of math-rich documents and improve their downstream mathematical reasoning capabilities by correctly classifying symbols in real-world scenarios.
