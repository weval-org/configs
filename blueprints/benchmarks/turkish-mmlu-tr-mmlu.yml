title: "Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU): Large Language Model Evaluation"
description: |
  The Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) benchmark is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess the linguistic and conceptual capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. It is constructed from a carefully curated dataset comprising 6,200 multiple-choice questions across 62 sections, selected from a pool of 280,000 questions spanning 67 disciplines and over 800 topics within the Turkish education system. This benchmark provides a transparent, reproducible, and culturally relevant tool for evaluating model performance, serving as a standard framework for Turkish NLP research. It enables detailed analyses of LLMs' capabilities in processing Turkish text and fostering the development of more robust and accurate language models.

  TR-MMLU emphasizes knowledge assessment as the primary metric, leveraging questions from standardized Turkish exams such as the University Entrance Examination and the Open Education Faculty (AUZEF) exams. These exams, designed to test student proficiency across disciplines, provide a rigorous and culturally relevant benchmark for assessing Turkish NLP models. The dataset covers diverse fields such as law, healthcare, history, and the arts, including specific examinations like the Medical Specialization Examination (TUS) and Public Personnel Selection Exam (KPSS).

  Key features include:
  - Natively designed for Turkish, avoiding translation-related errors and cultural mismatches.
  - Comprehensive topic coverage reflecting linguistic and conceptual diversity.
  - Curated to avoid overlap with pre-training data for unbiased evaluations.
  - Publicly available questions, answers, and evaluation scripts for transparency and reproducibility.
