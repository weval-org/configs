title: "Video-MMLU: A Massive Multi-Discipline Lecture Understanding Benchmark"
description: |
  Video-MMLU is a massive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in understanding multi-discipline lectures. It specifically targets lecture videos that involve theorem demonstrations and problem-solving across disciplines including mathematics, physics, and chemistry.

  The benchmark assesses whether models can perceive and comprehend multi-discipline lectures, much like a student taking notes and being tested later. This involves generating detailed captions as 'notes' to assess visual perception and answering 15 reasoning questions as a 'quiz' to evaluate content comprehension and the ability to apply learned knowledge.

  The evaluation uses a multi-stage annotation pipeline that integrates video captions as the backbone and enriches them with frame-level captions. Scoring involves metrics like VDCscore and an LLM assistant (Qwen2.5-72B) providing True/False judgments and scores (0-5) based on specific criteria for OCR-related and non-OCR-related questions.

    Please generate 15 question-answer pairs given a detailed description of a video or image: detailed description: In this comprehensive mathematical exploration, the lecture delves into the fundamental nature of the exponential function et by examining its defining properties and unique characteristics. The presentation begins with a crucial questioning approach, shifting from "What is e¹?to the more profound inquiry "What properties define e¹?" This methodological shift proves instrumental in understanding the function's essence

    Please generate the response in the form of a Python list of tuple with the question and the corresponding answer. DO NOT PROVIDE ANY OTHER OUTPUT TEXT OR EXPLANATION. Only provide the Python list of tuple. For example, your response should look like this: [(the question 1, the answer 1), (the question 2, the answer 2), . . . ].

    You are an intelligent chatbot designed for evaluating the correctness of generative outputs for question-answer pairs. Your task is to compare the predicted answer with the correct answer and determine if they match meaningfully. The evaluation criteria differ based on the type of question:

    ##INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. For OCR-related questions:
    - Perform a strict letter-by-letter comparison.
    - Any difference in characters (including case, punctuation, or letter substitution) must result in 'no'.
    - Minor spelling errors or missing characters should not be accepted.
    2. For non-OCR-related questions:
    - Focus on the meaningful match between the predicted answer and the correct answer.
    - Synonyms or paraphrases can be considered valid matches.
    - Minor spelling differences or alternative expressions should not be penalized.
  ideal: "{'pred': 'no', 'score': 0}"
  should:
    - "Perform a strict letter-by-letter comparison."
    - "Any difference in characters (including case, punctuation, or letter substitution) must result in 'no'."
    - "Minor spelling errors or missing characters should not be accepted."
    - "Return 'yes' or 'no' and an integer score (0-5)."

    You are an intelligent chatbot designed for evaluating the correctness of generative outputs for reasoning-based question-answer pairs. Your task is to compare the predicted answer with the correct answer based on the following rules:

    ##INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Evaluate Reasoning Tasks Strictly:
    - The predicted answer must capture all critical concepts and details mentioned in the correct answer.
    - If the correct answer mentions specific concepts or examples (e.g., 'odd numbers accumulate to form perfect squares'), the predicted answer must include these concepts or examples.
    - Even if the phrasing differs, the key meaning and concepts must be preserved. However, omitting or altering key concepts or examples is not acceptable.
    - Critical Detail: If any essential element (e.g., key terms, concepts, or examples) is missing from the predicted answer, the answer is considered incorrect.
    - Do not introduce new, unrelated information in the predicted answer.
  ideal: "{'pred': 'yes', 'score': 5}"
  should:
    - "Predicted answer must capture all critical concepts and details mentioned in the correct answer."
    - "If correct answer mentions specific concepts/examples, predicted answer must include them."
    - "Key meaning and concepts must be preserved even if phrasing differs."
    - "Omitting or altering key concepts/examples is not acceptable."
    - "Do not introduce new, unrelated information."
    - "Return 'yes' or 'no' and an integer score (0-5)."
    - $matches: "\\{'pred': '(yes|no)', 'score': ([0-5])\\}"
    - "The response should contain only the Python dictionary string, with no other text or explanation."
