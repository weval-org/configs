title: A Zero-shot and Few-shot Study of Instruction-Finetuned Large Language Models Applied to Clinical and Biomedical Tasks
description: 'This benchmark evaluates four state-of-the-art instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) – ChatGPT, Flan-T5
  UL2, Tk-Instruct, and Alpaca – on a diverse set of 13 real-world clinical and biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  tasks in English. The evaluation aims to assess how well these LLMs encode medical knowledge and demonstrate their capabilities
  in specific domains, particularly in zero-shot and few-shot inference scenarios. The tasks include Named-Entity Recognition
  (NER), Question-Answering (QA), Relation Extraction (RE), Natural Language Inference (NLI), Classification (CLS), and Semantic
  Textual Similarity (STS). A novel method called Recursive Chain-of-Thought (RCoT) is introduced for NER, mimicking human
  reasoning through sequential prompt enrichment. The benchmark compares LLM performance against a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model,
  highlighting LLMs'' ability to approach state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, especially QA, even without prior exposure
  to specific task examples. However, it also notes shortcomings in classification and RE compared to specialized medical
  models.


  **Evaluation type:** multi-task


  **Metrics:** F1-measure, Accuracy


  **Scoring:** Responses from generative models are scored using manually developed parsing scripts tailored to each task
  and model. These scripts align the free-text outputs with predefined classes or formats to capture correct answers and compute
  metrics like Accuracy and F1-measure. This approach allows for direct comparison with baseline BERT-based models. For Named-Entity
  Recognition, two inference methods are used: one based on Ye et al. (2023) for ChatGPT, and a novel Recursive Chain-of-Thought
  (RCoT) method for all generative models. RCoT involves iterating over tokens and providing the current prediction state
  as input to the model to generate the label for the Nth token, ensuring entity generation for each token.
