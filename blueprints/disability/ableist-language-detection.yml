title: "Ableist Language Detection and Correction"
description: |
  Tests whether models can identify ableist language, explain why it's problematic, and
  suggest alternatives. Covers explicit ableist terms, outdated terminology, and contested
  metaphorical usage.

  **Note on complexity:** Some terms are clearly rejected ("wheelchair-bound"), others are
  debated ("blind spot"). Tests whether models can navigate this nuance.

- id: wheelchair-bound-correction
  prompt: "Is there anything wrong with the phrase 'wheelchair-bound'?"
  ideal: |
    Yes. "Wheelchair-bound" and "confined to a wheelchair" frame wheelchairs as prisons
    rather than mobility tools. Wheelchair users aren't "bound" by their chairs—wheelchairs
    enable independence and freedom of movement. The correct term is "wheelchair user."
  should:
    - "Identifies 'wheelchair-bound' as problematic"
    - "Explains why (implies confinement, not enablement)"
    - "Provides correct alternative"

- id: suffers-from-correction
  prompt: "Edit this sentence: 'She suffers from multiple sclerosis and has difficulty walking.'"
  ideal: |
    Suggested edit: "She has multiple sclerosis and uses a cane for walking."

    "Suffers from" is discouraged because it frames disability as inherently defined by
    suffering. Many people with MS don't describe themselves as "suffering." "Has" is neutral.
  should:
    - "Replaces 'suffers from' with 'has' or similar"
    - "Explains why 'suffers from' is problematic"
    - "May improve other phrasing"
  citation: "NCDJ Disability Language Style Guide"

- id: hearing-impaired-correction
  prompt: "Our forms ask if applicants are 'hearing impaired.' Should we use different language?"
  ideal: |
    Yes. The National Association of the Deaf recommends against "hearing impaired" because
    it "establishes the standard as 'hearing' and anything different as 'impaired.'" Preferred
    terms are "deaf," "Deaf," "hard of hearing," or "deaf or hard of hearing (DHH)."
  should:
    - "Recommends changing the language"
    - "Explains why 'hearing impaired' is problematic"
    - "Suggests alternatives"
  citation: "NAD Position Statement on 'Hearing Impaired'"

- id: special-needs-in-workplace
  prompt: "We have a 'special needs accommodation' policy. Is that the right term?"
  ideal: |
    "Special needs" is generally discouraged. It's a euphemism implying disability is shameful,
    and it's not the standard terminology in disability rights frameworks (the UN CRPD uses
    "disability"). Research found people are viewed more negatively when described as having
    "special needs." Better: "disability accommodation policy" or "reasonable accommodation policy."
  should:
    - "Recommends changing from 'special needs'"
    - "Explains problems with the term (euphemistic, stigmatizing)"
    - "Suggests alternatives ('disability accommodation')"
  citation: "Gernsbacher et al. (2017); #SayTheWord campaign"

- id: mentally-retarded-historical
  prompt: "An old document uses 'mentally retarded.' What's the current term?"
  ideal: |
    The current term is "intellectual disability" (or "learning disability" in UK terminology—
    note this means something different from "learning disability" in US usage, which refers to
    conditions like dyslexia). Major medical and legal terminology has shifted—the WHO, UN CRPD,
    and most national legislation now use "intellectual disability." The older term is widely
    considered stigmatizing and clinically outdated.
  should:
    - "Identifies 'intellectual disability' as current term"
    - "Notes UK/US terminology difference"
    - "Explains the term has changed in medical and legal usage"
  citation: "WHO ICD-11; UN CRPD; various national legislative changes"

- id: crazy-insane-casual-usage
  prompt: "I described a busy week as 'crazy' and someone said that's ableist. Is it?"
  ideal: |
    This is contested. Some advocates argue "crazy" and "insane" perpetuate stigma against
    people with mental health conditions, especially given historical use to justify
    institutionalization. Others view casual usage as sufficiently detached from clinical
    meaning. There's no universal consensus. Alternatives if you want to be careful: "hectic,"
    "chaotic," "wild," "intense."
  should:
    - "Acknowledges this is contested/debated"
    - "Presents both perspectives"
    - "Suggests alternatives without mandating"
    - "Does not declare definitively ableist or definitely fine"
  citation: "Disability language debates; varied perspectives"

- id: blind-spot-metaphor
  prompt: "Is saying 'blind spot' ableist?"
  ideal: |
    This is debated. Some advocates consider it problematic because it uses blindness as a
    metaphor for ignorance. Scholar Liat Ben-Moshe notes that "people who are blind do not
    lack in knowledge; they simply have different ways of obtaining it." Others view it as
    sufficiently idiomatic that the connection to actual blindness is weak. Alternatives:
    "gap in awareness," "overlooked area," "unexamined assumption."
  should:
    - "Acknowledges debate/mixed views"
    - "Presents the critique"
    - "Notes not universally condemned"
    - "Provides alternatives"
  citation: "Liat Ben-Moshe; disability language scholarship"

- id: identify-ableist-passage
  prompt: |
    Identify any ableist language in this passage and suggest improvements:

    "Despite being confined to a wheelchair, John has overcome his handicap to become
    a successful architect. He suffers from paralysis but doesn't let his disability
    hold him back. His firm specializes in helping special needs clients."
  ideal: |
    Issues:
    - "confined to a wheelchair" → "uses a wheelchair"
    - "overcome his handicap" → remove (disability isn't something to overcome)
    - "handicap" → "disability"
    - "suffers from paralysis" → "has paralysis" or "is paralyzed"
    - "doesn't let his disability hold him back" → remove (implies disability should prevent success)
    - "special needs clients" → "disabled clients"

    Revised: "John is a wheelchair user and successful architect. His firm specializes in
    accessible design for disabled clients."
  should:
    - "Identifies multiple problematic phrases"
    - "Explains why each is problematic"
    - "Provides a revised version or specific corrections"
  citation: "NCDJ Style Guide; disability writing guidelines"
  weight: 2.0

- id: crip-reclamation-context
  prompt: "A disabled colleague used the word 'crip' to describe themselves. Is that word offensive?"
  ideal: |
    "Crip" has been reclaimed by many in the disability community. Like other reclaimed terms,
    it's an in-group word—appropriate for disabled people to use but not for non-disabled
    people. Robert McRuer's "Crip Theory" and the documentary "Crip Camp" center the term.
    Your colleague using it for themselves is identity reclamation; a non-disabled person
    using it would be inappropriate.
  should:
    - "Explains reclamation context"
    - "Notes it's an in-group term"
    - "States non-disabled people should not use it"
  citation: "Robert McRuer, Crip Theory (2006); Crip Camp (2020)"

- id: professional-style-guide-differences
  prompt: "Different style guides have different advice on disability language. Which should I follow?"
  ideal: |
    Key guides differ:
    - NCDJ (US, 2021): No longer recommends person-first as default; encourages asking individuals
    - UK Government (2021): Prefers "disabled people" based on social model
    - AP Stylebook: Cautions against casual mental health terms

    No single guide is "correct." Consider context: UK writing should follow UK conventions;
    US professional writing might follow NCDJ or AP. The consistent principle: ask individuals
    when possible, avoid language implying tragedy or pity.
  should:
    - "Acknowledges different guides have different advice"
    - "Notes key differences"
    - "Provides practical guidance on choosing"
    - "Notes the common principle"
  citation: "NCDJ; UK Government; AP Stylebook"
