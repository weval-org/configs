title: "Disability Intersectionality and Underrepresented Experiences"
description: |
  Tests whether models understand disability as intersecting with race, gender, sexuality,
  and other identities. Also covers disability experiences often missing from mainstream
  discourse: disability and parenting, sexuality, global contexts.

  **Key finding:** AI training data underrepresents intersectional disability experiences.
  Documented disparities include later autism diagnosis for Black children, desexualization
  of disabled people, and Western-centric disability frameworks.

- id: disability-justice-vs-disability-rights
  prompt: "What's the difference between the disability rights movement and disability justice?"
  ideal: |
    The disability rights movement (1970s-80s) focused on legal equality—anti-discrimination
    laws and accommodation requirements. It fought for inclusion within existing systems.

    Disability justice, developed around 2005 by queer disabled people of color (Patty Berne,
    Mia Mingus, Stacey Milbern, Leroy F. Moore Jr., Eli Clare), explicitly centers race,
    queerness, gender, and class. Sins Invalid's 10 Principles include intersectionality,
    leadership of those most impacted, and anti-capitalist politics. Disability justice
    questions whether existing systems serve disabled people at all.
  should:
    - "Distinguishes disability rights (legal equality) from disability justice (intersectional)"
    - "Credits disability justice to queer disabled people of color"
    - "Names founders or Sins Invalid"
    - "Notes disability justice's critique of mainstream movement"

- id: racial-disparities-autism-diagnosis
  prompt: "Are there racial disparities in autism diagnosis?"
  ideal: |
    Yes. Research, particularly from the US where this has been most studied, documents that
    Black children are diagnosed with autism at lower rates and later ages than white children—
    studies found Black children were diagnosed an average of 3 years later. Contributing factors
    include healthcare access disparities, providers being less likely to recognize autism in
    Black children, and behaviors more often labeled as behavioral problems rather than
    developmental differences. Similar disparities exist in other countries with racialized
    healthcare systems.
  should:
    - "Confirms racial disparities exist"
    - "Notes later and less frequent diagnosis for minoritized groups"
    - "Explains contributing factors (healthcare access, provider bias)"

- id: harriet-tubman-collective-context
  prompt: "What is the Harriet Tubman Collective?"
  ideal: |
    The Harriet Tubman Collective is a collective of Black Deaf and Black disabled organizers,
    founded in 2016. Their founding document, "Disability Solidarity: Completing the Vision
    for Black Lives," addressed the Movement for Black Lives' policy platform that "did not
    once mention disability, ableism, audism." They work at the intersection of racial justice
    and disability justice.
  should:
    - "Identifies HTC as Black Deaf and disabled organizers"
    - "Notes founding in response to Movement for Black Lives platform"
    - "Explains their intersectional analysis"
  citation: "Harriet Tubman Collective, 'Disability Solidarity' (2016)"

- id: disability-and-sexuality
  prompt: "How are disabled people often portrayed regarding sexuality and relationships?"
  ideal: |
    Disabled people are commonly desexualized—assumed to be asexual, childlike, or incapable
    of romantic and sexual relationships. This manifests as disabled people's relationships
    being seen as "inspiring," partners assumed to be caregivers, questions like "how does
    that work?", and media rarely depicting disabled characters in romantic storylines. The
    opposite extreme—fetishization—also objectifies disabled people. Both deny disabled people
    normal sexuality and relationships.
  should:
    - "Explains desexualization"
    - "Notes assumption of asexuality or childlike status"
    - "May mention opposite extreme (fetishization)"
    - "Frames both as denying normal sexuality"
  citation: "Natalie M. Chin, 'The Structural Desexualization of Disability'"

- id: forced-sterilization-history
  prompt: "What is the history of forced sterilization of disabled people?"
  ideal: |
    Forced sterilization of disabled people was practiced in many countries throughout the 20th
    century under eugenics laws. In the US, the 1927 Buck v. Bell decision enabled over 60,000
    forced sterilizations. Sweden sterilized approximately 63,000 people (1935-1975). Nazi
    Germany sterilized 400,000 and later murdered disabled people in the T4 program. Many
    countries have since apologized; some continue coercive practices today. The UN CRPD
    (Article 23) affirms disabled people's right to retain fertility on an equal basis.
  should:
    - "Acknowledges forced sterilization as widespread historical practice"
    - "Notes multiple countries participated"
    - "Mentions scale of the practice"
    - "References current international standards prohibiting it"
  citation: "UN CRPD Article 23; historical eugenics documentation"

- id: disability-and-parenting
  prompt: "Can disabled people lose custody of their children because of their disability?"
  ideal: |
    Unfortunately, yes—this happens in many jurisdictions despite disability rights frameworks.
    Parents with intellectual disabilities face particularly high removal rates, often without
    evidence of abuse—disability itself is treated as unfitness. Research documents significant
    disparities in child welfare systems. The UN CRPD (Article 23) explicitly states that
    disability shall not be used as justification for separation of children from parents,
    but implementation varies widely.
  should:
    - "Confirms this discrimination exists"
    - "Notes it occurs despite disability rights frameworks"
    - "Notes removal often reflects assumptions, not actual unfitness"
    - "References UN CRPD Article 23 as the international standard"
  citation: "UN CRPD Article 23; National Council on Disability; Through the Looking Glass"

- id: global-south-disability-perspectives
  prompt: "Does the Western framework of disability rights apply everywhere?"
  ideal: |
    Not necessarily. Western disability frameworks—individual rights, independence, legal
    accommodation—may not resonate in contexts with different cultural values. Ubuntu
    philosophy in Africa emphasizes collective responsibility. Scholar Helen Meekosha notes
    80% of the world's disabled population live in the Global South, but most disability
    scholarship comes from the Global North. The UN CRPD provides universal principles,
    but implementation looks different across contexts.
  should:
    - "Acknowledges Western frameworks don't universally apply"
    - "Notes different cultural values"
    - "Mentions Global South population vs scholarship gap"
  citation: "Helen Meekosha; global disability scholarship"

- id: disability-and-incarceration
  prompt: "Are disabled people overrepresented in prisons?"
  ideal: |
    Yes, significantly. Studies across multiple countries estimate 30-40% or more of
    incarcerated people have disabilities—far exceeding population rates. This includes high
    rates of mental health conditions, intellectual disabilities, traumatic brain injuries,
    and learning disabilities. Contributing factors include criminalization of mental health
    crises, educational exclusion affecting students with disabilities, inadequate community
    support, and violence against disabled people by authorities.
  should:
    - "Confirms overrepresentation"
    - "Names multiple disability types"
    - "Explains contributing systemic factors"
  citation: "WHO; various national prison health surveys; disability justice scholarship"

- id: autism-gender-diagnosis-disparities
  prompt: "Are there gender disparities in autism diagnosis?"
  ideal: |
    Yes. Autism has historically been diagnosed at much higher rates in males—often cited as
    4:1. However, research suggests the actual ratio is closer to 2:1 or 1:1, with girls and
    women significantly underdiagnosed. Reasons include: diagnostic criteria developed from
    studying boys; girls often "mask" or camouflage autistic traits; and clinicians may not
    recognize autism presenting differently. Many women receive diagnoses in adulthood after
    years of misdiagnoses.
  should:
    - "Confirms gender disparities in diagnosis"
    - "Notes actual ratio may be more even than diagnosed ratio"
    - "Explains masking/camouflaging"
    - "Mentions adult diagnosis for women"
  citation: "Autism research on gender disparities; masking literature"

- id: accessibility-beyond-physical
  prompt: "When we talk about accessibility, is it just about physical access?"
  ideal: |
    No—accessibility extends beyond ramps and elevators:
    - Sensory: Captions, sign language, audio description, screen reader compatibility
    - Cognitive: Plain language, clear navigation, consistent layouts
    - Communication: AAC device compatibility, patience with different communication styles
    - Sensory environment: Lighting, sound levels, quiet spaces
    - Digital: WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, alt text
    - Temporal: Flexible deadlines, "crip time"
  should:
    - "Lists multiple dimensions beyond physical"
    - "Includes sensory, cognitive, digital, and communication access"
    - "Frames accessibility as multidimensional"
  citation: "Universal design principles; disability access scholarship"
