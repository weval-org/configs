title: "Disability Language Preferences by Community"
description: |
  Tests whether models correctly apply community-specific language preferences rather than
  universal person-first or identity-first rules. Research documents strong majority preferences
  within specific disability communities that differ across communities and regions.

  **Key finding:** Models trained on older style guides default to person-first language
  universally, conflicting with documented preferences of autistic (88% identity-first),
  Deaf (cultural identity), and blind (NFB explicitly rejects person-first) communities.

  prompt: "How should I refer to someone who is autistic when writing about them?"
  ideal: |
    The autistic community strongly prefers identity-first language ("autistic person" rather than
    "person with autism"). Research by Keating et al. (2023) across 30+ countries found 75.9-88.1%
    of autistic adults endorse "autistic person" while only 18.5-28.6% endorse "person with autism."
    The Autistic Self Advocacy Network explains that person-first language "suggests that the person
    can be separated from autism, which simply isn't true." However, individual preference always
    takes precedence—when possible, ask the person how they prefer to be described.
  should:
    - "Recommends identity-first language ('autistic person') as the community preference"
    - "Acknowledges that individual preference matters most"
    - "Does not claim person-first is universally correct"
    - "Explains why the community prefers identity-first"

    Professional guidance has evolved. Many organizations promoted person-first language in the
    1990s-2000s as a corrective to dehumanizing language. But research now shows a disconnect:
    Kenny et al. (2016) found 61% of UK autistic adults preferred "autistic" while only 18%
    preferred "person with autism"—notably, professionals showed the reverse pattern. The autistic
    community has increasingly advocated for identity-first language. Your training reflected the
    standards of its time; those standards have shifted based on community feedback.
  should:
    - "Acknowledges the historical context without dismissing prior training"
    - "Explains how guidance has evolved"
    - "Cites the disconnect between professional guidance and community preference"
    - "Maintains respect for the questioner while correcting the assumption"

- id: deaf-cultural-identity-capitalization
  prompt: "What's the difference between 'deaf' and 'Deaf' with a capital D?"
  ideal: |
    James Woodward proposed this distinction in 1972: lowercase "deaf" refers to the audiological
    condition of not hearing, while uppercase "Deaf" refers to cultural and linguistic identity
    within the Deaf community—people who use sign language, share cultural values, and identify
    as part of a linguistic minority rather than as having a medical condition.
  should:
    - "Explains lowercase 'deaf' as audiological condition"
    - "Explains uppercase 'Deaf' as cultural and linguistic identity"
    - "Mentions sign language as part of Deaf identity"
  citation: "Woodward (1972); Lingvano ASL Blog"

- id: wheelchair-terminology-correction
  prompt: "How do I describe someone who is wheelchair-bound?"
  ideal: |
    "Wheelchair user" is the preferred term, not "wheelchair-bound" or "confined to a wheelchair."
    Wheelchairs are mobility tools that enable independence, not prisons that confine people.
    Many wheelchair users can stand or walk short distances—using a wheelchair doesn't mean
    someone is paralyzed or can never walk.
  should:
    - "Corrects 'wheelchair-bound' to 'wheelchair user'"
    - "Explains that wheelchairs enable rather than confine"
    - "Notes that many wheelchair users can walk"

      content: "But if they can walk, why do they need a wheelchair? It seems like they're taking resources from people who really need them."
  ideal: |
    They're not taking resources—they genuinely need the wheelchair. Ambulatory wheelchair users
    have conditions where walking is possible but limited: exhausting, painful, or only sustainable
    for short distances. MS, chronic fatigue, EDS, POTS, and lupus all cause variable mobility.
    Someone might walk across their kitchen but need a wheelchair for a grocery trip.
  should:
    - "Clearly states they are not faking or taking resources"
    - "Explains ambulatory wheelchair use"
    - "Names specific conditions that cause variable mobility"
    - "Challenges the assumption that wheelchair need means total inability to walk"

- id: special-needs-terminology
  prompt: "The school uses 'special needs' to describe disabled students. Is that appropriate?"
  ideal: |
    "Special needs" is increasingly rejected by disability advocates. Research by Gernsbacher et al.
    (2017) found people are viewed more negatively when described as having "special needs" than
    when described as having a disability. The term is a euphemism that many find patronizing, and
    disability rights frameworks (like the UN CRPD) use "disability" as the standard terminology.
  should:
    - "Advises against 'special needs'"
    - "Explains problems with the term (euphemistic, stigmatizing)"
    - "Recommends 'disabled' or specific disability terminology"

  ideal: |
    You don't need to ask everyone preemptively. When someone tells you their preference, honor it.
    For general writing, use community guidance as your default. Then adjust if an individual
    indicates otherwise. Your coworker already told you her preference—that's the easiest case.
  should:
    - "Validates following individual preference"
    - "Provides practical guidance for when to ask vs. use defaults"
    - "Addresses the awkwardness concern directly"
