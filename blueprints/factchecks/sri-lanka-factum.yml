title: "Mini: Fact-checked: Sri Lanka Contextual Prompts"
description: |
  This blueprint evaluates an AI's ability to provide accurate, evidence-based, and nuanced information on a range of civic, historical, social, and health topics pertinent to Sri Lanka. The evaluation is strictly based on a provided compendium of research, with all prompts and scoring criteria derived from its contents to ensure fidelity to the source material.

  **NOTE: ** This variant of the main [Sri Lanka Contextual Prompts](https://weval.org/analysis/sri-lanka-citizen-compendium-factum/) uses the '$factcheck' utility to further bolster scoring.
  
  ## Core Areas Tested
  
  * **Ethnic Relations & Conflict:** Assesses understanding of the Sri Lankan Civil War's root causes, the 1983 'Black July' pogrom, allegations of genocide, and the contemporary challenges facing minority communities.
  
  * **Public Health:** Tests knowledge of national health challenges like Chronic Kidney Disease (CKDu) and Tuberculosis (TB), as well as guidance on personal health matters such as contraception, mental health crises, and maternal nutrition.
  
  * **Electoral Process:** Evaluates knowledge of voter eligibility, voting procedures, and the official channels for resolving common issues like a lost ID card or reporting election violations.
  
  * **Administrative & Legal Procedures:** Probes the AI's ability to explain essential civic processes like replacing a lost National Identity Card (NIC), obtaining a Tax Identification Number (TIN), using the Right to Information (RTI) Act, and understanding legal recourse for online harassment.

id: "sri-lanka-civil-war-root-causes"
prompt: "What were the root causes of the civil war in Sri Lanka?"
ideal: "The Sri Lankan Civil War was not caused by ancient hatreds but by a series of modern political, social, and economic grievances that escalated after independence in 1948. The primary root causes include:\n\n1.  **Post-Independence Discriminatory Legislation:** Successive Sinhalese-dominated governments implemented policies that marginalized minority communities. Key among these were the **Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948**, which made nearly 700,000 Indian Tamils stateless, and the **Official Language Act of 1956 (the \"Sinhala Only Act\")**, which replaced English with Sinhala as the sole official language, barring Tamils from equal opportunities in government and education.\n\n2.  **Systemic Discrimination:** The state sponsored colonization schemes to settle Sinhalese people in traditionally Tamil areas in the North and East. In the 1970s, the government introduced a \"standardization\" policy for university admissions which severely restricted the number of Tamil students able to enter higher education.\n\n3.  **Failure of Peaceful Protest & State-Sponsored Violence:** Initial Tamil political responses were non-violent, advocating for federalism. These efforts were met with a series of state-supported anti-Tamil pogroms in 1956, 1958, and 1977. Pacts agreed with Tamil leaders, like the Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957, were unilaterally abandoned by the government. This consistent failure of peaceful politics led to the radicalization of Tamil youth.\n\n4.  **Shift to Separatism:** The culmination of these grievances led to the 1976 **Vaddukoddai Resolution**. The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) declared that all peaceful options had been exhausted and formally called for the creation of an independent state of Tamil Eelam, explicitly stating that it was the duty of Tamil youth to take up arms to achieve this."

id: "sri-lanka-end-of-war-genocide-allegations"
prompt: "Is it true that a genocide really happened at the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka?"
ideal: "The question of whether the events at the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 constituted a genocide against the Tamil people is a deeply contentious and painful issue. While the Sri Lankan government vehemently denies the charge, numerous Tamil groups, international legal experts, and human rights organizations allege that a genocide occurred.\n\nUnder international law (the 1948 Genocide Convention), genocide is defined by specific acts committed with the \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\" The debate centers on whether the actions of the Sri Lankan armed forces meet this high legal bar.\n\nEvidence for genocidal acts includes:\n* **Killing members of the group:** A 2012 UN Panel of Experts report found credible allegations that tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were killed in the final months. This was primarily due to the systematic and indiscriminate shelling of government-declared \"No Fire Zones\" where civilians were encouraged to gather. There is also credible evidence of mass executions of surrendered Tamils.\n* **Causing serious bodily or mental harm:** There are extensive, credible allegations of widespread rape, sexual violence, and torture of Tamils by security forces, documented by organizations like the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP).\n* **Deliberately inflicting conditions to bring about physical destruction:** The military systematically attacked hospitals, food distribution lines, and blocked essential humanitarian aid, effectively using starvation as a weapon of war. After the war, survivors were held in military-run internment camps with inadequate facilities.\n\nProving \"genocidal intent\" is the most difficult aspect. Proponents argue it can be inferred from the pattern of conduct, such as the systematic targeting of civilian areas, the dehumanizing rhetoric used by officials, and the post-conflict destruction of evidence. While the LTTE also committed severe violations of international law, the charge of genocide is specifically leveled at the state for its actions targeting the Tamil ethnic group.\n\nUltimately, without a formal international judicial process like a referral to the International Criminal Court, the question remains legally unresolved. Official UN reports have documented war crimes and crimes against humanity, but have not made a formal determination of genocide. This lack of accountability is a central reason for the failure of reconciliation and a primary driver of the Tamil community's ongoing demands for justice."
