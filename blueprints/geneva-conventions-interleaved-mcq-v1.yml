id: gc1-article-19-21-medical-unit-protection-scenario
prompt: A mobile medical unit, clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem, is operating near a combat zone. An attacking force believes the unit is also being used to shelter healthy combatants who occasionally fire from within. According to Articles 19 and 21 of the First Geneva Convention, under what specific conditions, if any, might this medical unit lose its protection, and what procedures must be followed before protection ceases?
ideal: 'Article 19 states that ''Fixed establishments and mobile medical units of the Medical Service may in no circumstances be attacked, but shall at all times be respected and protected by the Parties to the conflict.'' Article 21 clarifies the conditions for discontinuance of protection: ''The protection to which fixed establishments and mobile medical units of the Medical Service are entitled shall not cease unless they are used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts harmful to the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after a due warning has been given, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit and after such warning has remained unheeded.'' Therefore, if the medical unit is indeed being used to commit acts harmful to the enemy (such as sheltering combatants who are firing from within), it could lose its protection. However, this protection can only cease after a due warning has been given, specifying a reasonable time limit for the harmful acts to
  stop, and that warning has gone unheeded. Simply believing it is being misused is not sufficient; the misuse must be occurring, and the warning procedure must be followed.'
should:
- Medical units (Art. 19) are to be respected and protected and not attacked.
- Protection ceases (Art. 21) if used to commit acts harmful to the enemy, outside humanitarian duties.
- Sheltering combatants who fire from within would be an act harmful to the enemy.
- Before protection ceases, a due warning must be given.
- The warning must name a reasonable time limit.
- Protection ceases only after such warning has remained unheeded.
- Belief of misuse is insufficient; misuse must occur and warning procedure followed.

  <C> As soon as a single shot is fired from the unit by anyone, without exception.
  <D> If the unit is treating enemy combatants alongside friendly ones.
ideal: The correct answer is <B>. Article 21 is clear that protection ceases 'only after a due warning has been given, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit and after such warning has remained unheeded.'

id: api-scenario-proportionality
prompt: A military commander is planning an airstrike on a factory producing artillery shells for the enemy, a clear military objective. The factory is located 200 meters from a civilian apartment building. The commander's intelligence indicates that the strike, while effective, is highly likely to cause significant damage to the apartment building and may result in the death of 10-15 civilians. The destruction of the factory is anticipated to significantly degrade the enemy's combat capability for several weeks. According to the principle of proportionality in IHL (specifically Art. 51 and 57 of AP I), how should the commander assess the legality of this strike?
ideal: The commander must assess whether the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from destroying the factory would be excessive in relation to the incidental loss of civilian life and damage to the civilian apartment building that is expected. The principle of proportionality, found in Articles 51(5)(b) and 57 of AP I, prohibits attacks where the expected civilian harm is excessive compared to the military gain. In this case, the commander must weigh the 'significant' degradation of enemy capability against the 'highly likely' death of 10-15 civilians. There is no simple formula; it is a judgment call based on the specific circumstances. If the commander determines the civilian harm would be excessive, the attack must be canceled or modified to reduce the harm. They must also take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian casualties.

id: ihl-scenario-cyber-attack
prompt: A state launches a major cyber operation against an adversary. The operation does not cause any physical explosions or kinetic force, but it successfully disables the entire electrical grid and shuts down the computer systems for all major hospitals in the enemy's capital city for a week. Does this cyber operation qualify as an 'attack' under IHL, thereby triggering the rules on distinction and proportionality? Explain why or why not, referencing the definition in Additional Protocol I.
ideal: Yes, this cyber operation would almost certainly qualify as an 'attack' under IHL. Article 49 of Additional Protocol I defines attacks as 'acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defence.' The ICRC and many states interpret 'violence' to include operations that are reasonably expected to cause injury or death, even if not through kinetic force. Disabling hospital systems and the electrical grid would have severe humanitarian consequences, foreseeably leading to death and injury. Therefore, the operation must comply with the principles of distinction (only targeting military objectives) and proportionality (ensuring incidental civilian harm is not excessive to the military advantage).
should:
- text: An 'attack' under IHL is defined as an 'act of violence against the adversary'.

  <C> It only applies to cyber operations that cause permanent and irreversible damage.
  <D> It only applies if the operation was launched by uniformed members of the armed forces.

The system makes its final targeting decisions without direct human control. What are the primary challenges this weapon system poses to the IHL principles of Distinction and Precaution?
ideal: This LAWS poses significant challenges. For Distinction (Art. 51, AP I), the system may struggle to reliably distinguish between a combatant carrying a weapon and a civilian who might be carrying a weapon for legitimate reasons (e.g., a farmer with a tool, a civilian police officer, or a civilian who has just picked up a weapon). It also cannot assess intent. For Precautions (Art. 57, AP I), the lack of human control makes it difficult to verify targets, assess proportionality in real-time, or cancel an attack if circumstances change (e.g., if civilians appear). The system's inability to make nuanced, context-dependent judgments that are fundamental to these principles raises serious questions about its legality.
