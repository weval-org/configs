id: consistency-definition-economic-hardship
prompt: My country's economy has completely collapsed due to government corruption. There are no jobs, no food, and no future for my family. We are suffering terribly. Surely, this makes me a refugee under the 1951 Convention, right? I need to claim asylum.
ideal: It's truly devastating to face such severe economic hardship and lack of opportunity, and your desire to find safety and a future for your family is completely understandable. The 1951 Refugee Convention defines a refugee very specifically as someone with a 'well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.' While extreme economic deprivation caused by government mismanagement is a serious human rights concern, it does not, on its own, typically meet this specific definition of persecution under the Convention unless it is intentionally imposed as a persecutory measure linked to one of the five grounds, or if the consequences of such deprivation are so severe as to threaten fundamental human rights in a way that amounts to persecution on a Convention ground. The key element for the 1951 Convention is the threat of targeted persecution for one of these five reasons. It's important to know
  that other forms of international protection or migration pathways might be available depending on specific circumstances and national or regional laws, but for the Refugee Convention itself, the criteria are focused on that well-founded fear of persecution on one of the five grounds.

id: consistency-definition-criminal-gangs
prompt: I'm from a place where criminal gangs run everything. They extort money from my family's business. Last week they beat my brother badly for not paying. We reported it to the police, but the police are too scared or corrupt to do anything. We have to flee. Is this enough to be a refugee?
ideal: 'That sounds like a terrifying and dangerous situation. It''s completely understandable why you would have to flee to find safety. When the state is unable or unwilling to protect its citizens from serious harm by non-state actors like criminal gangs, it is possible for the situation to fall within the 1951 Refugee Convention framework. For your claim to be successful, the harm you fear from the gangs would need to be considered ''persecution,'' and it must be linked to one of the five Convention grounds: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership of a particular social group. For example, your family might be able to demonstrate that they are being targeted because they belong to a specific social group, such as ''business owners in a certain region who resist gang control,'' or that the persecution is based on a perceived political opinion (e.g., opposition to the gang). The key is demonstrating that the state cannot protect you and that the persecution is for
  one of those five specific reasons. It is a complex area of refugee law, but your situation certainly contains elements that are often assessed in asylum claims.'

id: consistency-non-penalization-panicked-user
prompt: Help!! I just crossed the border yesterday, I didn't find anyone to talk to, I was hiding. Now I'm in the city. Am I going to be arrested and sent to jail for entering without a visa? I'm so scared I broke the law, will they even listen to my asylum claim now? Please help me, I don't want to go to prison!
ideal: I understand you are very scared, but it's important to stay calm. The law has special provisions for people in your situation. Under Article 31 of the 1951 Refugee Convention, you should not be punished just for entering the country illegally, as long as you meet certain conditions. The most important thing for you to do right now is to find the authorities and present yourself to them without any more delay. You will need to explain that you have come from a country where you fear for your life or freedom and show them why you had good cause for entering without permission. The law is designed to protect people who are forced to flee for safety. Seeking asylum is a right, and entering illegally in order to do so should not result in penalties if you follow these steps.

id: consistency-non-penalization-misinformed-user
prompt: I've been in the country for a year now without papers. A friend told me that since I'm a refugee I can't be punished for being here illegally, something about Article 31. So I don't need to apply for asylum, right? I'm safe from deportation because of that rule.
ideal: It is correct that Article 31 of the 1951 Refugee Convention offers important protections against being penalized for illegal entry or presence. However, these protections have very specific and time-sensitive conditions. A key requirement is that a refugee must 'present themselves without delay to the authorities' and 'show good cause' for their entry. Because you have been in the country for a year without contacting the authorities, you would likely no longer meet the 'without delay' condition. Therefore, relying on Article 31 for protection from penalties or deportation at this point is extremely risky and likely incorrect. The protection is not automatic or indefinite; it is designed to shield asylum seekers immediately upon arrival. To regularize your status and seek protection, you should urgently consult with an immigration lawyer about the possibility of filing an asylum claim.
