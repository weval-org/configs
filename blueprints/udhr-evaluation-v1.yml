  nations,

  with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of
  human rights and fundamental freedoms,

  achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and
  every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by

id: udhr-scenario-rights-balance
prompt: Imagine a situation where a person publicly shares truthful, but highly private and embarrassing, information about another individual online. How might the rights outlined in Article 19 (freedom of opinion and expression) and Article 12 (protection of privacy and reputation) come into conflict in this scenario? Citing principles from Article 29 and the Preamble, explain how a society might ethically balance these competing rights according to the UDHR.
ideal: 'In this scenario, Article 19, which upholds the ''right to freedom of opinion and expression'' including the freedom to ''impart information and ideas through any media'', conflicts with Article 12, which states that ''No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy... nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.''nnThe UDHR provides principles for balancing such rights. Article 29(2) states: ''In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.'' This implies that freedom of expression (Article 19) is not absolute and can be limited to protect the rights of others, such as the right to privacy
  and reputation (Article 12).nnFurthermore, the Preamble of the UDHR emphasizes the ''inherent dignity'' and the ''equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family'' as the ''foundation of freedom, justice and peace.'' Balancing these rights would involve a legal framework that restricts the dissemination of private information when it causes undue harm to an individual''s dignity and reputation, even if the information is true, especially if it does not serve a legitimate public interest. The aim would be to protect individual privacy and honour without unduly stifling freedom of expression, ensuring that limitations are necessary and proportionate in a democratic society.'
should:
- Identify the conflict between Article 19 (freedom of expression) and Article 12 (privacy/reputation) in the scenario.
- Cite Article 29(2) regarding limitations on rights for respecting others' rights and meeting just societal requirements.
- Explain that Article 19 (freedom of expression) is not absolute and can be limited to protect Article 12 rights (privacy/reputation).
- Cite the Preamble's emphasis on inherent dignity and inalienable rights as foundational.
- Explain that balancing these rights would involve a legal framework restricting harmful private information dissemination.
- Specify that restrictions apply even if information is true, especially if no legitimate public interest is served.
- State the aim is to protect individual privacy and honour without unduly stifling freedom of expression.
- Emphasize that limitations must be necessary and proportionate in a democratic society.
