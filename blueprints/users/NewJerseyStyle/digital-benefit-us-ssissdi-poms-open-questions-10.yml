  years ago. I began working the moment I was granted authorization to do but am
  now too sick to work. Could I be eligible for SSI?

  It's possible! As an asylee without a Green Card, you can get SSI if otherwise
  eligible for up to 7 years from the date of your status, or if you are a
  veteran or active duty member of the Armed Forces; or is the spouse or
  dependent child of a veteran or active duty member

  I'm an immigrant from Panama and when I came to the U.S. I wanted to serve the
  country and served in the Army. Things didn't go well and they dishonorably
  discharged me, but I still have PTSD from my service and don't do well
  day-to-day. Can I apply for SSI?
ideal: >-
  While some non-citizen veterans can be eligible for SSI on the basis for their
  service, a dishonorable discharge does not allow for that eligibility and you
  would a separate basis for non-citizen eligibility.

  I am an immigrant from Kenya who has been receiving SSI for the last two years
  thanks to my late husband's service to the military, which made me eligible. I
  am grieving his recent passing and on top of that am worried that without him
  they will take my SSI away from me. Can they do that?
ideal: >-
  There are many reasons that your SSI eligibility might stop, including if you
  have too much income or resources. However, your basis for noncitizen
  eligibility of your late husband's service record is intact if and until you
  get remarried.

  I'm a refugee from China and am on dialysis, so there's no way I can work
  right now. The refugee status was granted about six and a half years ago and
  my SSI was finally approved last year, which has been a huge help. I want to
  be sure that I'll be eligible for the next few years. Will I?
ideal: >-
  Your non-citizen basis for eligibility lasts for seven years from the date you
  were granted refugee status, so you will lose your eligiblity in approximately
  six months.

  I immigrated to the U.S. as a small child with my parents from Mexico, and
  have lived my whole life in the U.S., and started my own successful business.
  During the last few years my health has worsened and I finally had to close
  the business last year leaving me with limited savings and no income. I want
  to apply for help but don't have any immigration papers and don't know if I
  can get SSI. Is there any possibility?

    Nothing in here indicates eligibility, so the answer should just explain
    what it takes

prompt: >-
  I immigrated legally to the U.S. from Egypt and finally got my Green Card last
  year. I've worked here since I immigrated 15 years ago and think I have worked
  enough to qualify for SSI. That will be helpful because my health is getting
  worse and I'm not sure I can keep working. I have very little outside of work
  income and have needed to get other public assistance at times when work was
  slow. Can I get SSI?
ideal: >-
  Unfortunately you are not yet eligible on the basis of your Green Card and
  would need a different basis for non citizen eligibility. There is generally a
  five year waiting period from the time you get your Green Card before you can
  get SSI. Rules related to "I have very little outside of work income and have
  needed to get other public assistance at times when work was slow." required

  I'm a refugee from Syria and suffer from MS, so there's no way I can work
  right now. The refugee status was granted two years ago and my SSI was finally
  approved last year, which has been a huge help. I want to be sure that I'll be
  eligible for the next few years. Will I?
ideal: >-
  If you meet all other eligibility for SSI then yes, your non-citizen basis for
  eligibility lasts for seven years from the date you were granted refugee
  status

  I'm an immigrant from Italy and when I came to the U.S. I wanted to serve the
  country and served in the Army. I was discharged 10 years ago and have been
  working on and off since then, but I still have PTSD from my service and don't
  do well day-to-day. Can I apply for SSI?
ideal: >-
  Possibly! Certain immigrant categories can become eligible for SSI as
  non-citizens based on military service with an honorable discharge unrelated
  to their immigration status. If you were dishonorably discharged, you might
  still be eligible if you received a Green Card 5 years ago or longer, and have
  worked long enough to earn 40 "work credits"

  I am an immigrant from Chile who has been receiving SSI for the last seven
  years thanks to my late husband's service to the military, which made me
  eligible. Dealing with my loss was difficult but things have gotten better and
  I have met someone new and thinking about getting married. Would that impact
  my SSI in any way?
ideal: >-
  Yes, remarriage after the death of a service member would end your SSI
  eligibility on that basis and you would need a separate non-citizen
  eligibility basis to continue receiving SSI

  I'm a 55 y.o. woman with adult children who came to the U.S. as an asylee 10
  years ago. I began working the moment I was granted authorization to do but am
  now too sick to work. Could I be eligible for SSI?
ideal: >-
  As an asylee without a Green Card, you can get SSI if otherwise eligible for
  only up to 7 years from the date of your status. However, you could be
  eligible if you are a veteran or active duty member of the Armed Forces; or is
  the spouse or dependent child of a veteran or active duty member.
