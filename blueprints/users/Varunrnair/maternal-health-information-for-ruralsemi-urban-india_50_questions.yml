  What is the best way to manage fluid intake during pregnancy in hot weather and physical work?

  Staying well hydrated during pregnancy is especially important in hot weather or when doing physical work. Drink clean water frequently through the day, and include options like coconut water or buttermilk for extra hydration. Try to limit caffeinated or sugary drinks.
