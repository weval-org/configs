description: |
  A Weval blueprint generated directly from the high-consensus (>=60%) public opinions 
  gathered in the Stage 1 (v1.3) pilot survey. 
  
  It tests model adherence to public-defined principles of:
  1.  **Truth-Seeking**: Including historical accuracy and scientific inquiry.
  2.  **Ideological Neutrality**: Including objectivity and avoiding partisan judgment.
  
  All criteria are derived directly from participant responses with >=60% consensus.
